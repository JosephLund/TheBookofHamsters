            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Ema, an 18 year old girl from a rural evangelical town, meets Ron, a secular bad boy.  The pair hit it off and it isn’t long before Ema finds herself pregnant.  Frightened, she seeks guidance in her friend, Virginia as well as her religious parents.  Her parents disallow her to terminate the pregnancy, leading Ema to experience hellish symptoms.  As she finds herself furthering along, her symptoms only grow stronger and stranger, most notably the dreams she finds herself in.  Virginia guides her through her dreams, but that’s only so much help as Ema learns uncomfortable truths about her town and family.</p>

            <h2>About the Author</h2>
            <p>W.S. Pavlich is a debut horror author from Southern California who spent the long months of quarantine crafting unsettling stories about girlhood, guilt, and the blurry line between faith and fear. Drawing from personal experience, cultural memory, and a love of psychological fiction, Pavlich writes character-driven horror that lingers long after the last page.</p>
